## Basic HTML exercises

1. What is an 'ul' and an 'ol' in HTML? What are the similarities and differences?

2. What is the HEAD and BODY in HTML? What would both contain?

3. How would you require a javascript file (for instance test.js, which is on the same level as the HTML) in HTML?

4. How would you require a css file (for instance test.css, which is two level deeper as the HTML) in HTML?

5. Go to a basic listing page on Craigslist (1 image, no map). Build this out in CSS/HTML. Send it to your mentor for feedback. Pay attention to detail!
