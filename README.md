# Mentor Exercise Repo

Because everyone can use a little more exercise.

This is a collection of exercises mentors may give students. To add your own exercise:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Add the exercises as a new file in the appropriate subdirectory. For example, if it's a Javascript exercise, add it to that directory.
3. Add a link from the README in the subdirectory to the exercise.
